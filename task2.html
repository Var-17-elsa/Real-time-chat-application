        <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Varshini K,
            I've done my graduation in bachelor of engineering on Electronics And Communication.

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>Here are some of my works :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Project 1<h4>Girls Hostel Security System</h4>This projects was to ensure the security of the students in the Hostel. This was designed using the IR sensor embedded along with the Arduino UNO with RFID Technology. Each were given with RFID, which contain a ID unique for every indivisual. The ID number of each student is recorded along with the student name. This design also helped in providing the information of any late entries into the hostel, also an alerting message to their parents in their absence.</li><br>
            <li>Project 2<h4>Solar Light Tracker Using Arduino</h4>This projects is designed to the utilize the natural light[Sunlight] to maximum extent.This Solar project was designed using Servo Motors, Arduino UNO, and solar panel. The solar panel is turned towards the direction of the sunlight with the help of the servo motor. LDR is used for photo conductivity. Further this project can be upgraded in a way that the exposed sunlight can be converted into another form of energy source. </li> <br>
            <li>Project 3<h4>Advanced IOT and ML to monitor the Underpass Water logging System </h4>This project was designed with IOT and Machine Learning. This System gives timely warning message of a flooding of the Underpass. This system also helps in avoiding traffic congestion by placing a LCD, to indicate which type of vehicle can pass in. The motor helps to pump the water in the underpass and helps in clearing the underpass. This projects gives an overveiw on the Real-Time monitoring and Improve Safety and Management  </li> <br>   
        </ul>
