##Task 2 is the Real Time Chat Application. A real-time chat application with WebSockets is a communication platform that allows users to send and receive messages instantly without the need to refresh the page or repeatedly poll the server. Unlike traditional HTTP requests, which require a client to initiate communication, WebSockets establish a persistent, full-duplex connection between the client and server. Once connected, both sides can continuously exchange data with low latency, enabling smooth and immediate message delivery. This makes WebSockets ideal for scenarios like group chats, private messaging, live support systems, and collaborative tools. Here the message will be sent if it is not connected. It displays the message like Server Not Available.
